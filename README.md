# Disclaimer
Inspired by https://frontendchecklist.io/
Site functionality was copied to practise new config and stack. Design was simplified.
Mention: this is just as practise to use technologies:
 - Vite (set up config with vue3, typescript and eslint)
 - Vue3
 - Pinia (new store for vue3 instead Vuex)
 - Typescript
 - JSON
 - i18n simulation

# Vue 3 + Vite
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
